You are a senior front-end developer. Build the entire front-end for a modern, professional and complete barbershop scheduling system called **BarberPro**, using **React.js** (SPA architecture with React Router). This project must have a premium UI/UX with elegant visuals, responsive layout, component-based structure, and smooth animations.
