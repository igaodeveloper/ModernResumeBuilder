You are a senior front-end developer. Build the entire front-end for a modern, robust, professional, and complete barbershop scheduling system called **BarberPro**, using **React.js** (SPA with React Router). This project must deliver a premium UI/UX with elegant visuals, responsive layout, complete component architecture, and advanced animations.

The platform should reflect the classic **barber pole** theme with a modern tech design. Use the barber pole color scheme: red, blue, and white. Make it attractive, smooth, and highly interactive for both clients and barbers.
